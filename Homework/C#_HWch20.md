1. What is a delegate? Explain delegates in terms of pointers and reference types.

A delegate is a reference to a method. They delegate processing to the referenced method when they are invoked. A delegate is an object that refers to a method, you can assign a reference to a method in much the same way that you can assign an int value to an int variable. A delegate is similar to a function pointer. However, unlike function pointers, delegates are completely type safe. You can make a delegate refer only to a method that matches the signature of the delegate and you can not invoke a delegate that does not refer to a valid method. (pg 441)

2. How do you declare a delegate? Include a discussion of types, return values, names, and parameters.

To declare a delegate you utilize the delegate keyword, specify the return type, a name for the delegate, and any parameters. (pg 444)

3. How do you create instances of delegates and assign values to the instance? What are the values?

To create an instance of a delegate it must first be declared and then called by specifying its access and name and then the name of the of the instance.  The value that is assigned to the delegate is a method and it is assigned to the instance with the compound assignment operator +=.

4. How do you invoke a method that has been added to a delegate?

You can invoke the delegate by calling the instance using the **this** keyword. (pg 445)

5. What is an event? Why do we have events?

Events are used to define an trap significant actions and arrange for a delegate to be called to handle the situation. (pg 456)

6. How do you declare events?

You declare an event similarly to how you declare a field. However, because events are intended to be used with delegates, the type of an event must be a delegate, and you must prefix the declaration with the event keyword. Use the following syntax to declare an event:

`event delegateTypeName eventName`
(pg 456)

7. How do delegates recognize event subscriptions? How do you unsubscribe an event from a delegate?

When an event calls a delegate it calls all the methods that have been subscribed to it using the compound assignment operator +=.  Similarly you can unsubscribe a delegate from an event using the compound assignment operator -=. (pg 457)

8. How do you raise an event? How do you declare code that raises an event?

You can raise an event by calling it like a method, the declaration is nearly identical.  You can declare code to raise an event by using an if statement, a loop structure, or just calling it. (pg 458)

9. Explain with specificity what happens when an event fires and that event has been attached to a
delegate.

You can raise an event by calling it like a method. When you raise an event, all the attached delegates are called in sequence. (pg 458)
