1. Describe the difference between a view and a partial view.

A partial view is a "sub-view" that you embed within a main view - something that you might reuse across multiple views, like a sidebar.

2. Throughout the book you have seen examples of LINQ, in your own words describe what it is
used for and how it works.

It is used to retrieve and modify data.

3. Look at this piece of code and tell me what it does, and where I would find it written:

A.
```routes.MapRoute(null, "{category}/Page{page}", new { controller = "Product", action =
"List" },new { page = @"\d+" });
```

B. Which call maps to 3a?

4. Give a brief explanation of the ASP.Net routing system.

ASP.NET routing enables you to use URLs that do not have to map to specific files in a Web site. Because the URL does not have to map to a file, you can use URLs that are descriptive of the user's action and therefore are more easily understood by users.

5. ASP.Net has a concept of child actions, can you describe it? How would you use it?

A child action is a controller action that you could invoke from the view using the Html.Action helper:

`@Html.Action("SomeActionName", "SomeController")`

This action will then execute and render its output at the specified location in the view. The difference with a Partial is that a partial only includes the specified markup, there's no other action executing than the main action.

6. What is a \_Layout.cshtml file? How do you use it, if at all?

It is the default layout for a web page. It is generally used as either a baseline layout for a page or the default layout when no specific one has been made.

7. What is a ViewResult? A PartialViewResult? An ActionResult? When/how would you use them?

ViewResult represents a class that is used to render a view by using an IView instance that is returned by an IViewEngine object. PartialViewResult is used to render a partial view. ActionResult represents the result of an action method.

8. What is an Entity and how is it used in this project?

Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper that enables .NET developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.

9. When creating a form in ASP.Net what command can you use that will generate the traditional
HTML element? What are action attributes and what kind of actions can a form perform?

HTML.BeginForm or the RenderBeginTag() method is called, which generates the beginning tag of the Web control's specified HTML element. An action filter is an attribute that you can apply to a controller action -- or an entire controller -- that modifies the way in which the action is executed.

10. What is an ASP.Net session state? How is it being used in this project?

ASP.NET session state enables you to store and retrieve values for a user as the user navigates ASP.NET pages in a Web application. HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that a Web server treats each HTTP request for a page as an independent request. The server retains no knowledge of variable values that were used during previous requests. ASP.NET session state identifies requests from the same browser during a limited time window as a session, and provides a way to persist variable values for the duration of that session. By default, ASP.NET session state is enabled for all ASP.NET applications.

11. Why would you create a separate Model object? What is it’s purpose?

By using separate API models, you can ensure that your API is as simple as possible, making your consumers’ lives easier. You can also cut down on how much data you send over the wire, improving performance and saving money on bandwidth by ensuring your API models are as lean as possible.

12. Describe some ways that Bootstrap was used in this chapter.

Bootstrap classes were used to style links as large buttons. (pg 208)
